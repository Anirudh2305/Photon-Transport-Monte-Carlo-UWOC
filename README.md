# Channel Modelling for Underwater Optical Communication using Monte Carlo Simulation.
The code models underwater photon transport using the Monte Carlo simulation. The source is taken as a diveregent circular beam. Link distance and receiver aperture 
diamater has been varied for different readings. The scattering angles are calculated using Henyey-Greenstein Phase function. The project involves plots for Intensity
vs Link distance and also the Channel Impulse Response which is the intensity received vs time of flight of photon.
